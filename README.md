# snake_water_gun_game
its a game of snake, water, gun developed in python where opponent is computer which makes it's choice and user have to enter his choice.  based on the choice result will be displayed  


--> The get_user_choice function takes user input and validates it to ensure it's one of the valid choices (snake, water, or gun).
--> The get_computer_choice function randomly selects one of the choices for the computer.
--> The determine_winner function compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner.
--> The main function orchestrates the game, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they choose not to continue.



Code Explanation:
    Importing the random Module: We start by importing the random module, which allows us to generate random choices for the computer's moves.

User Choice Function (get_user_choice):
    This function is responsible for taking the user's input and ensuring it's a valid choice (snake, water, or gun).
    It uses a while loop to keep asking for input until a valid choice is provided.
    
Computer Choice Function (get_computer_choice):
    This function randomly selects one of the three possible choices for the computer: snake, water, or gun.
    
Determine Winner Function (determine_winner):
    This function compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner of a round.
    It returns the outcome of the round as a string (e.g., "You win!" or "Computer wins!").
    
Main Function (main):
    The main function acts as the game's controller.
    It provides a welcome message and initiates a loop that allows the user to play multiple rounds.
    Inside the loop:
    It calls get_user_choice to get the user's choice.
    It calls get_computer_choice to get the computer's choice.
    It displays the choices made by both the user and the computer.
    It calls determine_winner to decide the winner and prints the result.
    It asks the user if they want to play again and continues the game or exits the loop accordingly.
    
Execution (if __name__ == "__main__":):
    This block of code ensures that the main function is executed only when the script is run as the main program (not imported as a module into another script).
    How the Game Works:
    The user is prompted to choose between "Snake," "Water," or "Gun."

The computer's choice is generated randomly.

The program compares the user's and computer's choices and determines the winner of the round based on the game's rules:

Snake beats Water (Snake wins).
Water beats Gun (Water wins).
Gun beats Snake (Gun wins).
If both the user and the computer make the same choice, it's a tie.
The outcome of the round is displayed (e.g., "You win!" or "Computer wins!").

The user is asked if they want to play another round. If they choose "yes," the game continues; otherwise, it exits.

The game continues until the user decides not to play anymore. It provides a fun and interactive way to make choices and determine the winner based on the rules of the game.
